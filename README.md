# AIR-BNB-Data-Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb hospitality data using SQL to derive actionable business insights. The datasets capture detailed information about listings, hosts, pricing, availability, room types, neighborhoods, and customer reviews. By applying structured SQL queries, the project converts raw CSV data into meaningful insights that highlight market behavior, customer preferences, and performance patterns within the short term rental industry. This project is designed as a portfolio level SQL case study, reflecting real world data analyst responsibilities and analytical thinking.

🎯 Objectives
The primary objectives are to analyze room type distribution, identify pricing trends across neighborhoods, evaluate listing availability, measure host performance, and understand the relationship between reviews, price, and demand. The project also aims to identify high performing locations and hosts based on activity and engagement metrics.

🛠️ SQL Skills Demonstrated
This project demonstrates strong SQL fundamentals including filtering and sorting using WHERE and ORDER BY, aggregation using COUNT, AVG, MIN, and MAX, grouping with GROUP BY, joining multiple tables using INNER JOIN, subqueries for deeper analysis, CASE statements for categorization, and DISTINCT to eliminate duplicate records.

📊 Sample Insights
Key insights include average price variation by neighborhood, popularity of different room types, listings with maximum yearly availability, hosts managing multiple properties, and the influence of reviews on pricing and demand.
